                           Commons Logging Package
                                Version 1.0.5
                                Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:
============

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Logging package.  

A new commons-logging-optional.jar has been introduced. This contains
classes which are not considered sufficient core to be included in the
commons-logging.jar. 

JCL 1.0.5 is adds optional improved automatic memory management
for containers which do not support JCL explicit memory release
during hot reployment (1.4+ JVMs only). To take advantage of this new
feature, the optional jar must be deployed with the core one. Use of
this feature is strongly recommended.

Note that the deprecated Log4JCategoryLog has been moved from the core
to the optional jar. Those using the 1.1.x series of Log4J releases 
should add the optional jar to their classpath. Others setting this
log explicitly are recommended to change to use Log4JLogger. This
change should not effect those relying on automatic discovery of 
Log4J by JCL.

The following paragraphs document changes since the previous release
(version 1.0.4). 

NEW FEATURES:
============

[MemoryLog]        An in-memory log implementation. May prove useful
                   in unit tests. Optional.
[ALL]              Improved memory management for hot deployment in containers
                   that do not explictly flush JCL. Use of this feature is strongly
                   recommended for all modern JVMs. Optional.

ENHANCEMENTS:
=============

[LogFactory]       Improved discovery for Log4J.

BUG FIXES:
=========

[AvalonLogger] 	   Fixed 

[LogFactory]       Fix addressing null pointer when logging is loaded by boot 
                   classloader for JRE's that return a null classloader in this situtation.

[ALL]              Added workaround for java 1.2.2 compiler bug.

DEPRECATIONS:
============

    (These are carried forward from Version 1.0.4)

[LogSource]        Previously deprecated, replaced by LogFactory.

[Log4jFactory]     A proxy instance of this class was transparently created
                   when Log4J logging was selected, yet it serves no useful
                   purpose.  The class is now deprecated, and the proxy
                   instance is no longer created.

[Log4JCategoryLog] This class has been replaced by Log4JLogger, which
                   corresponds to the availability of the new Logger class
                   in Log4J 1.2 and later. This is now distributed as optional.
